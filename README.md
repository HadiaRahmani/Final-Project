        Reclaim Your Heart by

        is not only a self-help guide. It is a handbook about the journey of the
        heart throughout the expanse of this life. It is a book about how to
        hold your heart back from sinking to the depths of that ocean, and what
        to do when it does. It is a book about recovery, about trust, about
        hope, about renewal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each heart can recover, and every moment is made to carry us closer to
        that great return. Reclaim Your Heart is about finding that moment when
        everything stops and suddenly seems different. It is about discovering
        your own awakening and then returning to the better, truer, and freer
        version of yourself. Many of us live our lives entangled by the same
        repeated patterns of heartbreak and disappointment. Many of us have no
        idea why this happens. <br />
        <br />
        Reclaim Your Heart is about freeing the heart from this bondage. It is
        about the journey in and out of life‚Äôs most deceptive traps. This book
        was composed to stir the heart and give another point of view on love,
        loss, joy, and pain. Providing a manual of sorts, Reclaim Your Heart
        will show readers how to live in this existence without allowing life to
        possess you. It is a handbook on how to secure your most valued
        possession,‚Äúthe heart‚Äù.
